# CSAT?

???

* Most of you are probably thinking 'what on earth is CSAT?'

# CSAT?

---

## According to Wikipedia:

> In its simplest form, CSAT is expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100, with 100% representing complete customer satisfaction.

Currently we rely upon the customer telling us if they are satisfied but we would like to be able to predict this in the future <i class="twa twa-smile"></i>

# Pacman?

???

* Pacman?  What's this all about?

---

layout: true
class: topic-template

# Pacman

---

* Gets it's name because it gobbles data, just like the video game character
* Background service written in Clojure
* Consumes ticket updates via Maxwell (which talks to Kafka)
* Creates background jobs that are ultimately sent to Crystal Ball for analysis

# Crystal Ball?

???

* Crystal Ball?  Are we dabbling in black arts now?

---

layout: true
class: topic-template

# Crystal Ball

---

* It's a rather apt name once you understand what it does
* HTTP API written in Python
* Uses machine learning to create a single data model for a customer
* Generates a CSAT prediction from ticket updates for a given customer data model

# Prediction App?

???

* Prediction App?  OK, you can probably guess what this one is all about :)

# Prediction App

name: csat-flow

???

* The Prediction App is the project name given to Pacman & Crystal Ball collectively
* Here you can see how all the services talk to each other
* It starts with a ticket update within Classic
* The ticket update is observed by Maxwell (which uses Kafka)
* Pacman listens to a particular topic in Maxwell and creates a background job which is bound for Crystal Ball
* Crystal Ball then process the request and returns a CSAT score
* The CSAT score is then written back to the ticket via the Classic API

# Infrastructure

???

* Not only are Pacman & Crystal Ball really intersting and unique, but so is the infrastructure powering them

---

layout: true
class: topic-template

# Infrastructure

---

* First customer oriented application in AWS!
* Managed by Chef but exists outside of our traditional DC setup
* Two prediction app clusters:
  * us-west-1 (married to SAC1 DC)
  * eu-central-1 (married to DUB1 DC)
* Both clusters have recently been completely recreated to more powerful instances (took a handful of hours)

???

* Here is an architectural diagram showing the proxy load balancer, proxies, app load balancers and app servers
* You can see all the AWS infrastructure in orange, married to the SAC1 data center via a VPN tunnel
* The identical setup exists for infrastructure in the eu-central-1 AWS region except it is married to the DUB1 data center and also connected via a VPN tunnel
* The main objectives of this architecture are
  * To ensure that a customers data model is only loaded into memory *once*
  * And to ensure resilience in the event of one or more proxy, app load balancer or app node becoming degraded
